# Progress: DesktopWhisperTranscriber

## Overall Progress

The project has completed Phase 2, which involved the specification and pseudocoding of the application. The initial implementation of the core modules (`main.py`, `transcriber_engine.py`, `main_window.py`) is complete.

## Completed Milestones

*   Phase 2: Specification and Pseudocoding.
*   Initial implementation of core application files.
*   Implementation of unit tests for `TranscriberEngine` (6 tests passing).
*   Implementation of unit tests for `MainWindow`, including long fragment functionality (tests passing).
*   Integration of language and model size selection.
*   Implementation of long transcription fragment handling.
*   Integration of YouTube audio download.
*   Integration of speaker diarization.

## Current Status

The project is currently at a stage where integration testing is the next immediate step. Unit tests for core components are passing, and the main features (transcription, saving, fragments, YouTube, diarization) have been implemented.

## Next Steps

*   Conduct integration tests with various audio inputs (local files, YouTube URLs, different durations).
*   Refine error handling based on testing results.
*   Consider further UI/UX improvements.
*   Explore options for packaging and distribution (future phase).
